## Exercise 2 - University Result

Write a program called UniversityResult. The program should accept a unit result (1-7) and output a message which includes a description of the result code. The required descriptions are listed below. If a student enters an invalid code, then the description should be "Invalid".

Unit Result	Description
7	High Distinction
6	Distinction
5	Credit
4	Pass
3	Failure
2	Failure
1	Failure
Notes:

The skeleton code will get the result code from the user and store the value in an integral variable named resultCode.
A variable called description of type string, has been declared but not initialised.
The skeleton includes a partly implemented switch statement.
Your task is to complete the implementation of the switch statement to assign a suitable value to description, based on the result code obtained from the user.
After you have assigned a value to description, skeleton code will emit the results to the standard output stream.
All input and output is carried out by the supplied skeleton code.
Do not attempt to rewrite the supplied code.
Do not replace the switch statement with any other construct – if, while, and for are prohibited for this exercise.
Do not perform any input or output operations other than those which are already supplied in the skeleton.
In this exercise, all supplied input text will consist of suitable numeric strings.

Tests will cover the following categories:

Valid result codes.
Invalid numeric result codes.
