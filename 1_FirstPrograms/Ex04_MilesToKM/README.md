## Exercise 4 - Miles to Kilometres
Complete a program that converts a distance measured in miles to the equivalent distance measured in kilometres. Use the following high-level algorithm:

Get the distance in miles, using the phrase "Please enter the distance in miles:" to prompt the user for input.
Compute the equivalent distance in kilometres, using the fact that 1 mile is equal to 1.609344 kilometres.
Display the conversion results in the form "M miles is the same as K kilometres.".
Replace symbol 'M' in the output message with distance measured in miles, expressed as a floating point value with three decimal places.
Replace symbol 'K' in the output message with equivalent distance in kilometres, formatted  as a floating point value with three decimal places.

Tests will cover combinations of the following categories:

Degenerate input: distance is zero.
Whole number input for distance.
Fractional input for distance.
