## Exercise 1 - Hello World
Write a “Hello World” program.

Complete a program that displays the text "Welcome to CAB201!" followed by a single new-line character.

Notes:

Use the WriteLine method of the Console class.
We recommend that you use the supplied skeleton (see the “Edit source code” tab) as the basis for your solution to ensure that the namespace, class, and method names are correct.
Keep it simple. Do not attempt to use advanced formatting or embedded control symbols.

Expected Outcome:
```
===========================
Welcome to CAB201!
===========================
```
