## Exercise 4 - Factorial

Complete the implementation of the Factorial program. The program should use a suitable loop to calcluate the factorial of a user-supplied integer value.

Notes:

As part of the supplied skeleton code, a variable called factorial of type decimal, has been declared and initialised to 1.
In addition, the skeleton code reads the value of limit, the value of which the factorial is required.
Your task is to complete the program by writing a suitable counter-controlled loop to compute the factorial of limit, using the definition available at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factorial.
After the loop terminates, skeleton code will emit the results to the standard output stream.
All input and output is carried out by the supplied skeleton code.
Do not attempt to rewrite the supplied code.
Do not perform any input or output operations oher than those which are already supplied in the skeleton.
In this exercise, all supplied input text will consist of suitable numeric strings which represent values between 1 and 27 inclusive.

Tests will cover the following categories:

Typical case: limit between 1 and 27 inclusive.
