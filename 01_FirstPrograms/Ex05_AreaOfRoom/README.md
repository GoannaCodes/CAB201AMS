## Exercise 5 - Area of Room
A carpet company has hired you to write a program that computes the floor area of rooms of various dimensions. The program should:

Get the width of the room from the user, using the phrase "Please enter the width of the room, in metres:" to prompt for input.
Similarly, get the length of the room from the user, using the phrase "Please enter the length of the room, in metres:" to prompt for input.
Calculate the area of the room (area is the product of width and length).
Displays the result, in the format "The floor area of a W by L metre room is A square metres.".
Replace symbol 'W' in the output message with the width of the room, expressed as a floating point number with two decimal places.
Replace symbol 'L' in the output message with the length of the room, also displayed with two decimal places.
Replace symbol 'A' in the output message with the area of the room, formatted with two decimal digits.

Tests will cover combinations of the following categories:

Degenerate input: width, height, or possibly both, are zero.
Whole number input for width and height.
Fractional input for width, height, or both.
